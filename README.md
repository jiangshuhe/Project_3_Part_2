# Assignment 3: Interactive Data Visualization

## Part 1


## Part 2

### Exploratory Visual Analysis
Based on Assignment 2, we additionally did an analysis of the main pollutants in each city using D3. From the interactive bar chart below we can see that the main pollutant for each city is basically PM2.5.

### Question
After the exploratory analysis, we would like to work on the following question.

Is there a certain monthly pattern of the AQI changes in the Pittsburgh area?

### The visualization Answering the Question
First, we processed the dataset in Python and calculated the statistical values of the air quality index in the Pittsburgh area for each month. Then we plotted the following interactive bar chart using D3.

## Overview of the Development Process
For this assignment, our team divided the work into parts, Shuhe was mainly responsible for part 1 and Junmo was mainly responsible for part 2 and the report. But we also met regularly to keep track of each other's progress and to help each other. Since none of us had been exposed to Java and JavaScript before, we spent a relatively large amount of time on this assignment, about 20h per person. It did prove to be a challenging development process for us, and the most time-consuming part was understanding the entire framework structure. We spent a lot of time learning the bar chart in the template and only after we fully understood it did we commit to the line chart drawing. After completing this assignment, we had a deep feeling that we need more practice to become proficient in the D3 language.
